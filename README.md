### Complete the following features:

**1. Add an Icon to the Stage:**
Add an icon to the application window using `stage.getIcons().add(...)`.


**2. Apply Dark Mode Using CSS:**
Create and link a CSS stylesheet to apply a dark mode theme to the entire UI.

**3.Show a Message Box on "Shop" Button Click:**
Add functionality so that clicking any "Shop" button opens a message box (e.g., using Alert).

**4.Enlarge Price Option on Hover**
Make each price option grow by 10% when the mouse hovers over it, using either CSS transitions or JavaFX event handlers.

Replace the message box (Alert box) with another scene that acts as a new "Payment Page".

Create a new FXML add layout for this scene.
